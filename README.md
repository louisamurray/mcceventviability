# Event Ticket Price Calculator
This is a simple web app that calculates the ticket price needed to reach a user-defined profit margin for an event. The user can input the following information:
- Tickets available
- Facilitator cost
- Venue cost
- Marketing cost *Note: To change these costs edit lines 5-14 of /js/script.js*
- Catering cost
- Event manager time (hours). *Note: Calculated at $35/hr by default. Edit line 17 of /js/script.js to update.*
- Misc cost
- Desired profit margin
The app will then calculate the ticket price needed to reach the desired profit margin, taking into account all the costs involved in the event.
