# Event Ticket Price Calculator

This is a simple web app that offers two different scripts for different calculation purposes:

-   `scriptTicket.js`: Calculates the ticket price needed to reach a user-defined profit margin for an event.
-   `scriptProfit.js`: Calculates the maximum profit for an event given the input values.

The user can choose the appropriate script based on their specific needs. The app takes into account all the costs involved in the event, including facilitator cost, venue cost, marketing cost, catering cost, event manager time, miscellaneous cost, and sponsor amount. The user can also download a CSV file with the input values and the calculated results.
